Before doing this, streamline code in app and town report. Abstract out what can be done in advance. Then show
* 2 pictures of all towns in state, contact and home
* Town trends
* top towns
* top cbgs

```{r}

load("ct_data.Rsave")


dat_by_town_lastweek_mean = aggregate(prob_sum_contact ~ town, data=dat_by_town_lastweek, mean)
dat_by_town_lastweek2_mean = aggregate(prob_sum_contact ~ town, data=dat_by_town_lastweek2, mean)

ntowns = dim(dat_by_town_lastweek_mean)[1]

dat_by_town_lastweek_mean$rank = ntowns + 1 - rank(dat_by_town_lastweek_mean$prob_sum_contact)
dat_by_town_lastweek2_mean$rank = ntowns + 1 - rank(dat_by_town_lastweek2_mean$prob_sum_contact)

dat_by_town_week_comparison = merge(dat_by_town_lastweek_mean, dat_by_town_lastweek2_mean, by="town", suffixes=c("_lastweek", "_lastweek2"))

rownames(dat_by_town_week_comparison) = NULL


ord = order(dat_by_town_week_comparison$prob_sum_contact_lastweek, decreasing=TRUE)

print(head(dat_by_town_week_comparison[ord,], 20))

write.csv(head(dat_by_town_week_comparison[ord,], 20), file="top_20_ct_towns.csv")
